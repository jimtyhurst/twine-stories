# Tinto tonight

## [Read the story](https://jimtyhurst.github.io/twine-stories/Stories/Tinto-tonight/Tinto-tonight.html)

## Notes

- This is my first attempt to write a story in [Twine](https://twinery.org/).
- I only used [hyperlinks](https://twine2.neocities.org/#markup_link); no other Twine features.
- During the writing process, I experimented with the [Find and Replace](https://twinery.org/reference/en/editing-stories/finding-replacing.html) feature in the desktop app, as I was refactoring text while inserting new passages.

## Development environment

- Twine 2.10.0 [desktop app](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/releases)
- [Harlowe](https://twine2.neocities.org/#introduction_what-harlowe-does-best) 3.3.9 story format
- macOS 15.4 [Sequoia](https://www.apple.com/macos/macos-sequoia/)
