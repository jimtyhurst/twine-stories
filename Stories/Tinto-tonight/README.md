# Tinto tonight

Read the story [here](./Tinto-tonight.html).

This is my first attempt to write a story in [Twine](https://twinery.org/).

I only used [hyperlinks](https://twine2.neocities.org/#markup_link); no other Twine features.

During the writing process, I experimented with the 'Find and Replace' feature as I was refactoring text while inserting new passages.

## Development environment

- Twine 2.10.0 [desktop app](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/releases)
- [Harlowe](https://twine2.neocities.org/#introduction_what-harlowe-does-best) 3.3.9 story format
- macOS 15.4 [Sequoia](https://www.apple.com/macos/macos-sequoia/)
